# db-class-website

Website for the main project for the Files and Database course, COMP 5531.

  TODO

WARM-UP:

- Continue to add pages with forms for each set of query operations as required by the assignment.
- Perhaps add some styling to the forms?

MAIN:

- Greatly improve the user validation for login (authentication). Consider hashing passwords.
- Add PHP for the dashboards to talk to the localhost database (e.g. submit, udpdate, get, for each section).
- Consider whether it might be worth it to actually have a proper MVC structure.
- Make everything as clean and modular as possible so that it can be easily changed later.
- Only *consider* making it responsive if absolutely everything else is done. Even then, no need.

  DONE  
********

- Added some basic PHP for insertions for the 'Warm-Up Project'
- Set up the ssh tunnel at localhost, which is now fairly easy to use
- Successfully performed insertions into the remote database
