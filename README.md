# db-class-website

Website for the main project for the Files and Database course, COMP 5531.

TODO:

- Greatly improve the user validation for login (authentication). Consider hashing passwords.
- Add PHP for the dashboards to talk to the localhost database (e.g. submit, udpdate, get, for each section).
- Consider whether it might be worth it to actually have a proper MVC structure.
- Make everything as clean and modular as possible so that it can be easily changed later.
- Finally, get set up with the SSH tunnel and populate a dummy database on Concordia server.
- Only *consider* making it responsive if absolutely everything else is done. Even then, no need.
